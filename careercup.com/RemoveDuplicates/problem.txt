1. Write a function that removes the duplicate of a collection of numbers and returns the number of elements remaining in the collection after the duplicates have been removed.
You must ensure that duplicates are actually removed from the list.

Example #2

Output

int removeDuplicates(List numbers) {
    // your code goes here
}
