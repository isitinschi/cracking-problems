You are given large numbers of logs, each one of which contains a start time (long), end time (long) and memory usage (int).
The time is recorded as MMDDHH (100317 means October 3rd 5PM)
Write an algorithm that returns a specific time (hour) when the memory usage is the highest.
If there are multiple answers, return the first hour.

e.g. 100207 100208 2
       100305 100307 5
       100207 100209 4
       111515 121212 1
Answer: 100207

(Need to consider different scenarios like the time slots could be very sparse)
