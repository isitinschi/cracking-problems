Statement: This is a very standard problem. Given a list of N ordered integers find the length of longest increasing subsequence in this list. 
Example: 
If the list is [16, 3, 5, 19, 10, 14, 12, 0, 15] answer is 5: one possible subsequence [3, 5, 10, 12, 15], another is [3, 5, 10, 14, 15].

Try designing a solution, which will work efficiently for N <= 2,000. 
Can you think of a solution working fast enough for N <= 2,000,000? 
You can experiment by generating your own tests and running your solution against them.
